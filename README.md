## About Me

Hi, I'm Simon. I am a Junior Full Stack Developer currently studying for a Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Development with Code Institute.

I love tech (who doesn't?) and I guess I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

I am forging a career change from the retail automotive rental sector into software and web development.

I have always enjoyed learning and undertaking this challenge is something I have wanted to do for a while.

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/simon-boylan).
